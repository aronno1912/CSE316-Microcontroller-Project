# CSE316-Microcontroller-Project
Our Project "Forget Me Not" is basically an automated Gardening system. Here we implementee automated watering system based on humidity of soil.We also implemented an automated shedding if temperature rises too high.
If the water tank is empty,The bot will notify the user via telegram.
